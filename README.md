# MedFuzz
The MedFuzz platform automates creating a fuzzing capable build
of a software under test (e.g. DICOM Toolkit), manages the fuzzing
process and performs network communication with the target software
using the component medfuzz-net and automates filtering redundant
results. It supports DICOM-Toolkit/AFL (see `fuzzing/dcmtk`) and
Fo-Dicom/SharpFuzz (see `fuzzing/fodicom`, experimental).

## Important:
_Medfuzz is experimental software and must only be run in
strictly isolated test enviroments dedicated to fuzzing only.
Under no cirumstances should MedFuzz be operated on production
systems or connected to networks_

## Operating environment
MedFuzz was developed and tested for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Operation
on other platforms is may require changes. The following
instructions are specific to an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS plattform.

## Build
MedFuzz is written in C++ and bash script and requires various
packages to be installed in order to compile the medfuzz binary.

To install required packages execute:
```
sudo apt install afl++ build-essential cmake wget libgtest-dev libgmock-dev
```
Clone the medfuzz repository and run `cd medfuzz`. Download dependencies into the `medfuzz/include` subdirectory:

```
cd include
# Download CLI 1.8.0 (or newer)
wget https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/releases/download/v1.8.0/CLI11.hpp
# Download googletest
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.15.2 && cd googletest && cmake .
make
make install
 ```

To build medfuzz change back to the medfuzz directory and execute:
```
make && make preload
```

## Usage
MedFuzz is a command-line utility and supports the following
options. The mode option `-m` is mandatory.
